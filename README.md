# 5241 Project: 

Term: Spring 2021

+ Project title: Deep Learning on MINST Dataset

+ Project Summary: This project contains two problems of number recognition and number addition. The first problem is solved by three different models including ANN and CNN on the MINST dataset. The final accuracy we obtained is over 99%. The second problem is solved by LeNet5 and a 6-layer CNN, and got over 95% accuracy at last. The second dataset is composed by images containing two digits with the label equals the summation of two numbers. This project is implemented by TensorFlow, Keras. 

+ Code can be found in the main.ipynb and ran directly in Google Colab

+ Report is saved in doc directory for reference

+ Results are saved in data directory that can be accessed directly from the code.
